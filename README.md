# DnD_manager
D&amp;D Manager built with C# ASP.NET and Bootstrap

No complex logic implemented yet, and no CRUD features.  Current plan is to implement MongoDB for a NoSQL database.  Starting with a character manager feature + user accounts.  Eventually want to expand to manage NPCs and Monsters, and perhaps class, race, and spell databases users can browse and lookup info in.  Longterm plan to implement features useful to GMs running and managing games.
